I am a software engineer currently working on Just Walk Out technology for Amazon Physical Stores. This is the tech that started out powering [Amazon Go](https://youtu.be/NrmMk1Myrxc) stores and has now been introduced to some Amazon Fresh; [third-party ](https://justwalkout.com/); and, most recently, Whole Foods Market stores.
