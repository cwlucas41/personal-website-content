		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<div class="section">
			<p>I am a computer engineering and computer science student at Saint Louis University. I expect to graduate in May of 2017 with a B.S. in C.E. and C.S. and a minor in engineering mathematics.</p>
			<p>I am interested in computers, programming, and design. I decided to study computer engineering because of my aptitude for technology and interest in the field. Before college I thought that I wanted to go into computer hardware design, microprocessors specifically. However, during my second semester of collge I took the required C.S. introduction course, learning object-oriented programming with Python. That course and subsequent C.S. courses made me think twice about a career in software. So, I added C.S. as a secondary major to further explore my interests and learn even more about computing.</p>
			<p>My favorite course, thusfar, has been Computer Architecture. The course started with an introduction to the C language and then translating C into assembly. The course continued to examine how assembly instructions are executed on processors. The course took a "top-down" look at microprocessors, starting with a higher level of abstraction and working downwards.</p>
			<p>Next semester, I am most excited for the microprocessors course. The course will build on my knowledge from "Digital Design", which covered combinational and sequential logic, and will provide a "bottom-up" study of microprocessors.</p>
			<p>I am not a web-designer.</p>
