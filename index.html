			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<div class="section">
				<p>I am a <b>computer engineering</b> and <b>computer science</b> student studying at Saint Louis University. I expect to graduate in May of 2017 with a B.S. in C.E. and C.S. and a minor in engineering mathematics.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<p> My first real experience with programming was an online C++ course that I took in high school. I was frustrated with the course because I had no knowledge of how my code was actually working; I knew nothing about compilers, microprocessors, or digital logic. I realized that a career in software would not interest me unless I understood more about how computers work.</p>

				<p>When I was choosing a major to study in college, I knew that I wanted to study engineering and technology. Remembering my experience in high school, I decided to study computer engineering. After being introduced to analog circuits and digital logic, computers made more sense to me, but it was not until I took Computer Architecture that I understood how hardware and software work together. After learning about how high-level code is transformed into machine code and executed on a processor, I realized that I would be content to work at the software level, but I didn't know if I was truly interested in software. I added computer science as a secondary major to explore this option further.</p>

				<p>As I took more computer science courses, they became my favorite classes. I started applying for software development engineering internships for the summer of 2016 because I was pretty sure I wanted to persue a career in software. I was selected to be an intern for Amazon in Seattle, WA in the Alexa organization. As I completed the internship it became evident to me that I had absolutly made the right choice. I truly enjoy developing quality software and I want to to keep learning.</p>

			<div class="section">
				<p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, reading, and craft beer.</p>
				<p>I enjoy cooking because I like making things with my hands and I recognize it is an applied science. One of my favorite cookbooks is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Cooking-Cooks-Illustrated-Cookbooks/dp/1933615982/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">The Science of Good Cooking</a>.</p>
				<p>I didn't enjoy reading until I bought a Kindle. I read both for pleasure and education. Some of my favorite books are <u>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</u> and <u>The Phoenix Project</u></p>
				<p>I love a good IPA. My favorites are Bell's Two Hearted Ale and Fremont Brewing Company's The Sister.</p>

			<div class="section">
				<p>Lastly, I am not a web-designer. This main purpose of this site is to be a résumé that is easily sharable and always up-to-date. I have some experience, all self-motivated, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but do not consider myself a web-developer.</p>
